# About
Train double-jointed arms to reach target locations using Multi-agent RL in Pytorch

## Agent Output Demo


## Reacher Environment
* Set-up: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
* Goal: The agents must move it's hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
* Agents: The environment contains 10 agent linked to a single Brain.
* Agent Reward Function (independent): 
  * +0.1 Each step agent's hand is in goal location.
* Brains: One Brain with the following observation/action space.
  * Vector Observation space: 26 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm Rigidbodies.
  * Vector Action space: (Continuous) Size of 4, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.
  * Visual Observations: None.
* Reset Parameters: Two, corresponding to goal size, and goal movement speed.
* Benchmark Mean Reward: 30
